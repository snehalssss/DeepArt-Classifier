Developed deep learning model to classify art styles with
custom CNN and ResNet50, achieving 96% validation
accuracy through fine-tuning.
Applied transfer learning on ResNet50 by freezing 143
layers while fine-tuning the final block for enhanced
feature learning.
Employed data augmentation techniques..
Preprocessed and normalized image data (200×200×3)
with ImageDataGenerator.
Utilized TensorFlow, Keras, sklearn, and libraries like
skimage and matplotlib for modeling, evaluation, and
visualization tasks
